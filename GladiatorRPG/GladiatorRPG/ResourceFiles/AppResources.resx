    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Wow. I did not think anyone would be able to finish this game because of how simple it is. Anyway thanks for pulling yourself through everything that my first "proper" game I ever made has to offer  ;)
I probably won't update this game further apart from maybe bugfixing so feel free to go on adventure in different games.
I hope to see you again in my future game releases hopefully more ambitious than this.
Best wishes to you my friend!

Thanks for playing!

    <value>You feel like you are reaching the end of the granary's cellar. In front of you instead of a corridor leading to another chamber you are presented with destroyed wall with a passage to an underground cave. You check your surroundings and can not find any other way forward so you get ready and move in. Almost immediately you are engulfed in horrible stench even worse than before. Not long after you enter a somewhat big opening. With your torch up you see a lot of vermin running away from you. For sure it's the nest of them. You see that the base of this cave is packed with flammable things like grain, feces and some kind of dried up vegetation. While you were getting ready your other torch to light the nest up you can hear a roar from other part of this cave. After not a long while you hear many heavy footsteps and squealing of stomped rats with them. In front of your eyes presents a horrible being, Rat King. Gigantic creature with the size similar to a bear, maybe even bigger. You are horrified by this monstrosity but you don't even have a chance to retreat before it charges you head on.</value>

    <value>The monstrosity quickly overpowers you. During your pitiful try to kill the Rat King his fangs sinks into your shoulder and then flings you back to the entrance.

    <value>As you open the heavy granary doors, you look for a hatch leading to the long-forgotten cellar below. The air is thick with spoiled grain and animal filth. As you step further into the dark, worn wood creaks under your weight. After a while, your eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, allowing you to see further. You found a worn olive lamp with a few drops of fuel in it. Using the lamp it doesn't take long for you to locate the hatch hidden under the rotten hay pile. As you swing it open, a putrid stench of decaying flesh washes over you, nearly causing you to retch. You prepare your torch and, with a hopeful glance at the ladder, begin your descent, praying that it will hold your weight in the depths below.</value>

    <value>With meticulous attention, you navigate through the dense cobwebs, each step weighed down by the sticky strands. Despite the gradual progress, you remain resolute, driven by the determination to breach the passage's entanglement. Time stretches on endlessly as the webs seem to multiply, enveloping you in a suffocating embrace of silk. Your movements grow labored, limbs heavy with exhaustion, yet you press on, fueled by an unyielding resolve to reach the other side.
The oppressive darkness of the cobweb-laden passage threatens to engulf you, but you refuse to succumb to despair. With each painstaking step, you feel the weight of exhaustion creeping into your bones, threatening to halt your progress. Yet, you persist, drawing upon every ounce of strength and resilience within you to push forward. With each agonizing moment that passes, victory edges closer, a beacon of hope amidst the encroaching darkness.</value>
